# Gold-Price-Prediction-Forecasting-with-LSTM-
In this project, I build and train an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model using TensorFlow and Keras to predict future gold prices based on historical data from 2015 to 2025. This project covers everything from data preprocessing, scaling, and sequence creation to training an LSTM model and evaluating it using real-world gold price trends.
